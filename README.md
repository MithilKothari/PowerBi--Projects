## Problem Statement

Many people working in IT face a common challenge: figuring out which areas of the industry provide a good balance between work and personal life, along with being satisfied with their salary. Since a survey was conducted over two months, we have valuable data, but the absence of a comprehensive and easily accessible dashboard still makes it tough for individuals to make smart decisions about their IT careers. We need a solution that utilizes the survey findings to gather and present data in a simple way, helping people compare work-life balance and salary satisfaction across different IT fields. This way, individuals can make better-informed decisions about their career paths.


### Summary for Steps followed 
1. **Collecting Data:**
   - First, we gathered information by asking people about their work and salary satisfaction in the IT industry through a survey.

2. **Loading Data into Power BI:**
   - Next, we took all the survey answers and put them into a program called Power BI. We used an Excel file to store this information.

3. **Checking Data in Power Query Editor:**
   - We looked closely at the data in Power BI using something called Power Query Editor. In this editor, we checked various options to understand the data better.

4. **Making Sure to See All Data:**
   - Usually, Power BI shows details for only a limited number of responses. We wanted to see details for all responses, so we made sure to look at the information for the entire dataset.

5. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Since the information we got was a bit messy, we spent time fixing and organizing it to make sure it's accurate and useful.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - After cleaning up the information, we started making visual images, like charts and graphs, using Power BI. These visuals help us see and understand the survey data about work-life balance and salary satisfaction in a simpler way.
